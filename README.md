In this library project an user can create an small collection of books he/she wants to read or have already read. The books are presented in cards where some information about them is displayed (author,title, number of pages, cover). When trying to add a new book to the library, only the title field is required. In case the other fields are left empty, these would be filled with "-" and a default cover.

This exercise was done using vanilla JS, html and css.
